Dota 2 is a game, so I think it fits the DAE / GD profile.  
  
You can switch between the local and api repository, by pressing the button in the bottom right. This button is only visible on the overview page.  
  
There are several heroes for which getting their itempopularities results in a bad gateway error.  
Even when pasting the link in a browser.  
List of those heroes:  
anti mage  
clinkz  
dawnbreaker  
earth spirit  
earthshaker  
elder titan  
invoker  
io  
lycan  
muerta  
nyx assassin  
omniknight  
phantom assassin  
phoenix  
puck  
razor  
sniper  
sven  
tinker  
tiny  
ursa  
winter wyvern  
wraith king  
  
But maybe it's specific to me, I'm not sure.  
Maybe it will be fixed in the future.
